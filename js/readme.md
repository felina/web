- `models`: Contains Backbone Models – modules that encapsulate a particular item in the application, and the data and methods associated with it.
- `collections`: Contains Backbone Collections, which are groups of Models.
- `shared`: Miscellaneous code needed by multiple pages.
- `pages`: The main scripts for each page of the site, one per page.
- `user_profile`: The scripts used to run the user profile.
